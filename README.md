# "World Cup Qatar 2022" project

> This is my personal "World Cup Qatar 2022 International Conference" website which I created for the Microverse assignment, in this project we had to choose our own website idea and create home and about page. Since I've always been the football fan I chose to create something like fake World Cup 2022 conference, and from this moment I'm writing this all the football fans are waiting for that big moment which is in a few months from now.
